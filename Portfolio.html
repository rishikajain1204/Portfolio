      <img src="A3 composition.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="LOOKING THROUGH YOU,   This work was created when I was first introduced to Adobe photoshop. In this artwork I have incorporated and explored every tool that I had learned in photoshop. The collage includes almost all the elements of arts which are form, line, shape , space and a few others. The looking through me title is evident by the boy peeking through the middle of a girl's body this narrates how the boy is trying to look through the girl. The contrast between the black used for the girl and other colorful elements around the girl including the boy peaking through, this describes the personality of the girl, how she is more dark and dull, where as the boy looking through her is more lively and brighter, and as he looks through her and her personality, it's trying to make it more colorful and bright. The circular and the abstract lines show confusion and the dripping black color from her hat shows the darkness leaving her, the red eyes and lips are to show danger and caution (trying to look through her). The bright green color shows positivity and joy. The hand is part of the aesthetic in the painting trying to show something holding her hat. I have made a very prominent use of eyes for the audience to clearly relate the title to the work.

This is a distorted abstacrt work inspired from a still life that I assembled together. This distruction to the abstract art is a process where you are able to see much more details like the shapes the lines and other such elements. This stillife includes a spray bottle and a peice of cloth.

        <img src="2.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="In this captivating abstract art piece, a myriad of colors converges harmoniously, yet it is the resplendent hues of pink that dominate the canvas, creating a striking visual impact. The artist skillfully employs various elements of art such as texture, form, and contrast to convey a profound emotional narrative. The canvas comes alive with a dynamic interplay of strokes, each brushstroke serving as a vessel for the artist's intricate emotions.

        The amalgamation of frustration and love is palpable in the intricate details and bold choices of color. Shades of pink, ranging from soft pastels to vibrant magentas, coalesce seamlessly to evoke a complex emotional spectrum. The deliberate use of strokes adds an additional layer to the narrative, with frenetic lines capturing the essence of frustration, while gentle curves and blends symbolize the warmth of love. This abstract masterpiece transcends the boundaries of conventional art, inviting viewers to explore the delicate dance between conflicting emotions and the vivid interplay of colors that define the human experience." style="width:97%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="artwork">

      <img src="CITY STORIES ( EDITED )2.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="CITYSTORIES,  “Mumbai is the best”, I have heard this phrase so many times before coming to this city. This phrase had pumped me up so much to explore the “Amazing” city. After shifting to Mumbai for college..I might just say it was not how everybody described it as it was very fast, too much traffic, a lot to explore, everything very far and a lot more. But there are few things that make it special in its own way. And with this collage I have shown what makes Mumbai special as per me and my experience. This was made after just being there for one month. Starting with the lady, she shows how women dress, they have a very particular style and I've seen them mostly wearing sarees with similar colors on it. It's their cultural dress. Then the fountain, I loved how vintage it looked and the details on the fountain just amazed me. Then for the stones on the background are the weird shaped stones that are placed near the marine drive. Marine drive is one of my fav spots with water and fresh air, and these stones were the first thing that I noticed. There were multiple questions that popped into my head after seeing them, but I think that is what makes it special and weird. Then the taxi’s, In my hometown there are no taxis like these. These are like the original form of taxis with the yellow and the black (kali pili), these were exactly how people described it to me. Lastly the road, which was to show the way to mumbai and the blue was to symbolize the sea and water all around Mumbai. The text Mumbai was compressed within the circle for the taxis to be highlighted, and the other elements too.

        <img src="Collage .jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="CAUTION, The artwork conveys a powerful message centered around confidence, the struggle for rights, and the societal barriers that hinder individuals from expressing themselves. People speaking up for their rights, regardless of gender, suggests a theme of empowerment and the importance of raising one's voice. This theme can be seen in the hand blocking the mouth, which symbolizes the societal forces that attempt to silence individuals and restrict their freedom of expression. The widely opened eyes depicted in the artwork convey a strong sense of confidence and strength. Their gaze is directed towards the viewer, projecting a message of self-assurance and defiance in the face of adversity.Red is commonly associated with caution, danger, and power. Its prominent use in the artwork underscores the idea that each individual possesses inherent power and the right to assert themselves. By employing the color red, the artwork emphasizes the urgency and significance of individuals taking control of their own lives and asserting their rights. Punctuation marks, such as exclamation marks, are commonly used in language to convey emphasis, strong emotions, or a sense of urgency. In the context of the artwork's title, the inclusion of two exclamation marks amplifies the impact and significance of the power theme, drawing the viewer's attention to it with greater intensity." style="width:97%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="artwork">

        <img src="collage abstarct.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="In this captivating abstract collage art, the central theme revolves around the enigmatic relationship between a man and his camera. The artist skillfully employs mixed media to convey a sense of mystery and introspection. The focal point of the composition is the obscured face of the man, cleverly concealed behind the lens of the camera. This deliberate choice invites viewers to contemplate the identity and emotions of the subject, creating an air of anonymity and intrigue. The camera becomes a symbolic mediator, simultaneously revealing and concealing aspects of the individual's persona.

        Doodle lines emanate dynamically from the camera lens, intertwining with vibrant colors that add a dynamic and playful dimension to the artwork. These whimsical lines serve as visual metaphors for creativity, imagination, and the boundless possibilities that unfold when one engages with the art of photography. The juxtaposition of the concealed figure, the camera, and the lively doodle lines sparks a dialogue about the interplay between reality and artistic expression. The result is a visually arresting collage that not only captures the essence of the photographer-subject relationship but also invites viewers to explore the intersection of perception and creation within the realm of abstract art." style="width:97%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="artwork">

The reason was to completely change its appearance. After the collage was made it gave the original work a very different personality to it, as it changed its mood and the tone it was trying to portray.

        <img src="mango logo 1.1 .jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="I took on the task of redesigning the logo for the clothing company Mango, while taking into consideration the existing aesthetics of their current logo. During my search for inspiration, I came across an abstract font on Instagram that caught my attention. Within that font, I noticed that the letter g had a shape that resembled a mango when I stared at it for a while. Given that Mango is a clothing brand, I established certain specifications for the logo, such as elegance, minimalism, and a modern touch. With these criteria in mind, I transformed the letter g into a mango shape using a continuous line and a bold font. Additionally, I selected a more refined font to complement the logo, aligning it with the desired elegance.

      <img src="My work 2.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt=" CROSSOVER,  This artwork is inspired by the brand Jaywalking. When I first heard of the brand the name really facinated me it sounded really cool yet classic to me, then when I understood the meaning of the term It instantly gave me an idea for an collage, with my on going learning of photoshop I tried to explore clipping mask tool which helped me bring my idea to life. For this work I used the clipping mask tool to cut the face picture of the boy into an siloette of a man walking. I have used the same image of the boy that I used in the previous work, then tried to create an illusion of the man within a man, and added a shadow. The man in the middle walking symbolises the term Jay, and then I have added the word walk in the background to merg the 2 words and create jaywalk. The word walk uses the vouge font, and have used the arc tool to shape each of the letters, and used the color red for it to pop out and catch the attention of the audience." style="width:97%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="artwork">

        <img src="om dar-b-dar 0.2.jpg" class="w3-round-small" alt="OM-DAR-B-DAR,   For the collage I wanted to add multiple scenes from the movie jumbled together to show the nonlinear structure that it was following and to show confusion which was my take on the movie. Then I thought of adding the hole in the wall scene to my collage to make it resemble from the movie. After that to give it a vintage and retro look I did the coffee stain to the paper to make it look like a old wall. 
        I printed out the other elemts that I wanted to add in the collage and started to place them out and arranging them until it looked nice." style="width:97%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="artwork">
